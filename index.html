Said            The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.

              <h2>IOT And Mobile based cattle health and environment monitoring system</h2>
            <p>The IOT based cattle health and environment monitoring system monitors various cattle health parameters such as body temperature, heartbeat, location of animals and environmental parameters such as temperature. This also explains how the primary sensors identified by the research can be used to forecast cattle health in a simple, basic manner. Monitoring the activities and health of the cattle continuously and taking corrective measures help in increasing the milk productivity. This helps in preventing the cattle from diseases at early stage and also increases the milk yield.</p>

            <p>We are creating an A.I assisted Chatbot in our app, where people can search for food they want in exchange.
              We will try to tie up with workers of “KIRANA STORES”. Initially delivery of supplies will be within 5 km of user. If everyone from different villages start using this app. Then we can create a web throughout the country where there will be intra and inter deliveries between cities and villages.
              Since its quite difficult to get address of people in villages. Our app will take help of geolocation coordinates and create a shortest distance of traversal between point A to B.
